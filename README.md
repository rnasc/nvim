# NeoVIM setup 

I decided to give NeoVIM a try and to do that... well, it's un-natural to use 
a VIM-like editor without any plugins... at least for development purposes.

With that in mind I cloned the NeoVIM setup below:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad ~/.config/nvim --depth 1 && nvim

```
## Plugins 

Other than the Plugins suggested/implemented by NvChad, I also added the following
plugins to my instalation:
```
Ag - Silver Searcher - I just love it... it's fast and furious!

```

## Key Mappings

Another thing I have changed was the Leader. Instead of using <space>, I'm
using <,> (Comma), as I'm mostly used to that.
